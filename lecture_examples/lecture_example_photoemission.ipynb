    "We want to compute the first ionization potential for benzene, i.e., the binding energy for the HOMO level. The self-energy is provided in the file `self_energy_analytic_state_21.dat` and was computed with $G_0W_0$@PBE. (Level 21 is the HOMO level since benzene has 42 electrons and is closed shell). The first column are the frequencies and the second column is the real part of the self-energy and the third column the imaginary part of the self-energy. Note that the first column is in eV, but the second and third in atomic units (conversion to eV needed). For the HOMO level we have further\n",
